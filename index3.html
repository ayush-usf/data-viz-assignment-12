<body>
    <div>Incorrect due to the following factors
        <ul>
            <li>Intentionally complex and cluttered visualization - Not at all pleasing, rather disturbing</li>
            <li>Axes are misleading - How can the minimum length, width or height of a vehicle be 0. Only min torque value can be ZERO </li>
            <li>Wrong color scales are used </li>
            <li>Title is skewed - Only a few Cadillac's vehicles have higher torque than its competitor, some are lower also </li>
            <li>No evidence about the source of the data</li>
        </ul>
